# OTC Execution Toolkit (Concept Blueprint)

This is a lightweight blueprint of an OTC execution toolkit designed to improve quoting, hedging, settlement, and reconciliation for a digital asset OTC desk.

## Components

### 1. Price Aggregator
Fetches best bid/ask + depth from multiple exchanges:
- Binance
- Coinbase
- OKX
- Kraken

Purpose:
- Identify executable mid-price
- Detect pricing inefficiencies
- Detect liquidity dislocations

### 2. Quote Engine
- Computes fair mid-price
- Adds configurable spread (bps)
- Generates two-way quote for RFQs

### 3. Hedge Executor
- Executes hedges in small clips
- Routes orders to best venue based on price + depth
- Supports TWAP-style execution
- Tracks fills in real time

### 4. Settlement Tracker
- Verifies wallet addresses
- Monitors blockchain confirmations
- Tracks fiat/USDT settlement status

### 5. Reconciliation Engine
- Matches internal booking vs exchange fills
- Validates fees, timestamps, and tx hashes
- Flags mismatches for manual review

## Why This Matters
This toolkit reduces:
- Slippage
- Market impact
- Operational risk
- Manual errors

And improves:
- Execution speed
- Quote accuracy
- Settlement reliability
- Desk efficiency

## Technologies (Example)
- Python (API calls, automation)
- SQL (reconciliation)
- REST/WebSocket APIs (market data)
- Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Grafana/Kibana (monitoring)

This is the type of system I can help build and maintain in a startup OTC environment.
